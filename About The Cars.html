The name Brio means vivacity or verve in Italian.[1] In Indonesia, Brio has an additional Indonesia-inspired name for the country's LCGC (Low Cost Green Car) program. The name Satya (Sanskrit: true, genuine, sincere or faithful) is used, with added local distributor's name combined as "Honda Prospect Motor Brio Satya" as its official LCGC name.

            Since initiation, Honda has offered several different car body styles and versions of the Accord, and often vehicles marketed under the Accord nameplate concurrently in different regions differ quite substantially. It debuted in 1976 as a compact hatchback, though this style only lasted through 1989, as the line-up was expanded to include a sedan, coupe, and wagon. By the Accord's sixth generation at the end of the 1980s, it evolved into an intermediate vehicle, with one basic platform but with different bodies and proportions to increase its competitiveness against its rivals in different international markets. For the eighth generation of the Accord released for the North America market in 2007, Honda had again chosen to move the model further up-scale and increase its size.[1] This pushed the Accord sedan from the upper limit of what the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) defines as a mid-size car to just above the lower limit of a full-size car,[2] with the coupe still rated as a mid-size car. In 2012, the ninth-generation Accord sedan, with smaller exterior dimensions, was once again classified as a mid-size car at 119 cubic feet (3.4 m3), falling just shy of the "Large Car" classification. However, the current 10th-generation Accord, with similar exterior dimensions, returned to full-size car status with its combined interior space of 123 cubic feet (3.5 m3). The coupe has since been discontinued.

After a period of developing idiosyncratic automobiles such as the Honda 1300 that met a lukewarm response in both Japan and North America, Honda considered pulling out of automobile manufacturing altogether by the early 1970s. However, Honda released a more conventional automobile in 1972 called the "Civic" which immediately reversed their flagging fortunes due to its economy, reliability and low cost in an era of rising fuel prices. The Civic utilized Honda's CVCC technology, later used in the Accord, to help Honda meet emission standards of the 1970s and early 1980s without the added expense of a catalytic converter.[3]
